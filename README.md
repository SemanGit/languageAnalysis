# languageAnalysis
Programs used for language analysis that are part of the master thesis


Usage:

java -cp languageAnalysis.languageAnalysis.main.jar tableConverter.tableConverter /path/to/input/csv /path/to/output/csv blocksize

The blocksize determines how many bytes of a programming language form one entity to be watched in the alluvial chart.
Higher number produces smaller output, but decreases precision
